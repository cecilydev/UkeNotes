# UkeNotes - Model
This section includes the data analysis done in Google colab (Jupyter Notebooks).

Originally I thought I would be using TensorFlow to build a model to be converted to TFLite for Android.  In the end, with notes, a machine learning model did not seem to be needed.  If chords are later pursued, spectrograms of the chords could probably be used to create a model.
